# Notion Database To Unity Scriptable Object

![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-2020.3.x_or_higher-critical?style=for-the-badge)

A system to import Notion database data into a Unity scriptable object for use in game. 
<b>Note:</b> This is experimental. While functional, there may be issues or edge cases that are not covered. Updates will also be slow/infrequent.

# Supported data types
| Property type | Conversion types supported (Unity) |
| --- | --- |
| Title | ```string``` |
| Text | ```string``` ```NotionDataWrapper(GameObject(Prefab)/Sprite/AudioClip)``` |
| Number | ```int``` ```float``` ```double``` etc |
| Toggle | ```bool``` |
| Single-Select | ```string``` ```enum``` |
| Multi-Select | ```string[]``` ```List<string>``` ```enum flags``` |
| Rollup | ```Any supported from above types.``` |
| Date | ```SerializableDateTime``` |

Any ```string``` convertible should also support JSON for custom classes, but the mileage may vary. Best to just store raw data in these assets and convert the data with an override to the ```PostDataDownloaded()``` method in the ```Notion Data Asset```. Note that rollups are supported only when they show a property that is otherwise supported.

# Setup Guide

## ðŸ’½ Notion setup
You need to make an integration in order for the downloading to work. You can make an intergration <a href="https://www.notion.so/my-integrations">here</a>. The steps to follow are:
- Make a new integration with the ```New integration``` button.
- Select the workspace the integrations can access. This should be the workspace the database(s) you want to download are in.
- Give the integration a name & continue to the next page.
- Navigate to the ```Capabilities``` tab from the sidebar and ensure the integration has read access. You can disable the rest as you only need the readability.
- Navigate to the ```Secrets``` tab and copy the key for use in Unity.

Once done you can then enter Notion and add the integration to one or multiple pages to allow the Notion API to access the data. This is done from: ```... > Manage Connections > "Find and add your integration from the options"```
If you don't see the integration you just made listed, close & open Notion and follow the steps again.

## ðŸŽ® Unity setup
In Unity you use a ```Notion Data Asset``` to store the data. This is just a scriptable object which has a custom inspect or to aid with the data download. Each instance you wake will consist of the data asset, a scriptable object class and the data class which holds the data structure for the data asset to store. There is a tool to make these for you which can be found under ```Tools > Notion To Unity > Asset Creator```

### Asset creator
The asset creator is an editor window that handles creating the classes for a ```Notion Data Asset```. You just enter a name for the class you want to make and press ```Create``` when ready. You'll be able to see a preview of what the classes will be called before your press the ```Create``` button. Once pressed you'll be able to select where you want to save each newly generated class. Its best to keep them together in the same directory for ease of use.

Once setup you'll just need to write your data class to have the fields you want. An example of a Persona healing skill data class

```
    [Serializable]
    public class DataHealingSkills
    {
        /* â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
        |   Fields
        â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” */

        [SerializeField] protected string skillName;
        [SerializeField, TextArea] protected string desc;
        [SerializeField] protected NotionSpriteWrapper icon;
        [SerializeField] protected SkillType type;
        [SerializeField] protected ActionTarget target;
        [SerializeField] protected SkillCost cost;
        [SerializeField] protected NotionPrefabWrapper effect;
        [SerializeField] private float power;
        [SerializeField] private StatusAilment cureAilments;
        [SerializeField] private bool canRevive;
    }
```

### Downloading the data

To download your data you will need the link to the database page and the secret key for the intergration you made earlier. The Database link can be grabbed from the ... menu on the page the database is on:

Then just fill the fields on the data asset (make one from the ```CreateAssetMenu``` if you haven't already) and then press the download button. If all goes well you'll see a dialogue stating so. If it fails you should see the error in the console.

<i>(Image from The Cart implementation of the system, so secret key is in a global field, you'll have to assign it per asset with this setup).</i>


### Wrapper classes
Some data needs a wrapper class to assign references. This is provided for GameObject prefabs, Sprites & AudioClips should you need it. They are assigned by the name of the asset when downloading the data.


### Post Download Logic
You can also manipulate the data you downlaod after receiving it by writting an override to the method called ```PostDataDownloaded()``` on the ```Notion Data Asset``` . Note if you need to run editor logic, make sure it is in a #ifdef. An example below:

```
#if UNITY_EDITOR
        protected override void PostDataDownloaded()
        {
            skillLookup = new SerializableDictionary<string, DataHealingSkills>();
            
            foreach (var data in Data)
            {
                // Runs a method called PostDownloadLogic() on the data class instance.
                data.GetType().GetMethod("PostDownloadLogic", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance)
                    ?.Invoke(data, null);

                // Adds the data class to a lookup for easier use at runtime.
                skillLookup.Add(data.Name, data);
            }

            // Saves the changes to the scriptable object.
            UnityEditor.EditorUtility.SetDirty(this);
            UnityEditor.AssetDatabase.SaveAssets();
        }
#endif
```

## Usage Example
Below is an example using the system to store data for Persona 5 healing skills for persona's
